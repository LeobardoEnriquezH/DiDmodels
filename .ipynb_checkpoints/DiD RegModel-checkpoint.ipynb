    "Calculating the value of the response variable.  The goal is to study the effect of the 2005 hurricane season on house prices in the coastal states, using the state-wise All Transactions House Price Index published by the US Federal Reserve. The time series data sets are selected for the 24 states of interest and knock them together into a 24-state data panel.  The time periods of interest are the 4 quarters immediately prior to the 2005 hurricane season and the 4 quarters immediately following the season. For each state, calculate the average quarter-over-quarter (Q-o-Q) fractional change in the house price index over the two sets of quarters (pre and post): $HPI Fractional Change = \\frac{HPI_i — HPI_{i-1}}{HPI_{i-1}}$. Next, take the vertical average of each block of 4 quarters to arrive at the average fractional change in HPI across 4 quarters both before and after the 2005 hurricane season. Repeat this calculation for each state to get the value of the response variable HPI_CHG for the pre-treatment and post-treatment phases. For each state, there are two response values: the top value is the pre-treatment value and the bottom one is the post-treatment value. Thus, there is one value corresponding to Time_Period=0 and another one corresponding to Time_Period=1. The column  HPI_CPG is our response variable $y_i$.\n",
